In order to use crabgrass with postgresql, you will need to take these additional steps:

1. Create a postgres user, and verify that you can log in:
   psql -U username -W

1a. If your postgres user does not have the ability to create databases, create a database that the postgres user can access

2. edit config/database.yml -- see environment test_postgres as an example
2a. If your postgres user cannot create databases, make sure the database is the same as the one created in 1a.

3. Make sure you have the libpq-dev package installed:
   sudo apt-get install libpq-dev

4. install the postgres gem
   gem install postgres
